<p>Reporting</p>

<p>If you are being harassed by a member of the CivicActions Accessibility community, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the CivicActions Accessibility Anti-Abuse Team. If the person who is harassing you is on the team, they will recuse themselves from handling your incident. We will respond as promptly as we can.</p>

<p>This code of conduct applies to CivicActions Accessibility sponsored spaces, but if you are being harassed by a member of the CivicActions Accessibility community outside our spaces, we still want to know about it. We will take all good-faith reports of harassment by CivicActions Accessibility community members, especially bloggers, seriously. This includes harassment outside our spaces and harassment that took place at any point in time.The abuse team reserves the right to exclude people from the CivicActions Accessibility community based on their past behavior, including behavior outside CivicActions Accessibility spaces and behavior towards people who are not in the CivicActions Accessibility community.</p>

<p>In order to protect volunteers from abuse and burnout, we reserve the right to reject any report we believe to have been made in bad faith. The CivicActions Accessibility Anti-Abuse Team is not here to explain power differentials or other basic social justice concepts to you. Reports intended to silence legitimate criticism may be deleted without response.</p>

<p>We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them, if we believe that doing so will increase the safety of CivicActions Accessibility members or the general public. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
Consequences</p>

<p>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.</p>

<p>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the CivicActions Accessibility Anti-Abuse Team may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from all CivicActions Accessibility spaces and identification of the participant as a harasser to other CivicActions Accessibility members or the general public.</p>
