I"<p>CivicActions Accessibility site is a work in progress, but as part of this we are attempting to follow the best practices we are documenting.</p>

<p>The site is built primarily leveraging the <a href="https://designsystem.digital.gov/">U.S. Web Design System</a> which has undergone extensive testing on accessibility</p>

<p>The color pallett is based on work with the <a href="https://civicactions.github.io/uswds-color-tool/">USWDS Color Compare Tool</a>.</p>

<p>The pages are compiled using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> and are written either in Markdown or HTML5. The site is hosted on <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a></p>

<p>Our goal is to be as accessible as we can make it and would like it to exceed WCAG 2.1 AA where possible. If you run into any barriers please contact us - accessibility@civicactions.com - with details to help track down the problem.</p>
