# Engineer Emery
Emery is always on GitHub, contributing back to projects they are interested in. They've cloned lots of repos and have more downloaded on their hard drive. Some of their projects involve accessibility, so they want to learn more. 

Emery just has one eye, but that doesn't stop them. Unfortunately, some VR solutions don't work for them, and they feel sick if there is too much animation on the screen. 

## Goals
Learning best practices about accessibility, particularly for dynamic sites

## Needs
Ability to turn off animations or possibly run the site without JavaScript 

## Thoughts
Will the site have motion on it that makes me feel sick?

## Feelings
Worried the site won't respect my need for reduced motion

## Behaviors
Sometimes disables images on their browser to not worry about them

## Pain points
Sites that are visually more complicated than needed
