## Comparisons with Section 508

VPAT is predominately used in the USA, so Section 508 Refresh version is the most common format. There is a lot of redundant information between the reports because the section Section 508 Refresh aligned with WCAG 2.0 AA. It is very unusual to see specific requirements for WCAG 2.x AAA and VPAT 2.4 treats AAA requirements no differently than A or AA.

The big difference here is that 508 include tables for **Chapter 3: Functional Performance Criteria**, **Chapter 4: Hardware**, **Chapter 5: 501.1 Scope, 504.2 Content Creation or Editing**, **Chapter 6: 602.3 Electronic Support Documentation**. The Section 508 version also includes notes that Table 1, 2 and 3 apply to more than simply the web, but also Software; Authoring Tool and Support Documentation. The WCAG document includes both WCAG 2.0 & WCAG 2.1 criteria. None of the WCAG 2.1 Success Criteria (SC) show up in Section 508. As is standard within the Web Accessibility Initiative, WCAG 2.1 includes all of WCAG 2.0.

## WCAG vs EU

WCAG includes just the web guidelines, where as the EU version includes all of EN 301 549 (version 3.1.1). Similar to the prior comparison, EU includes a lot more than the web and there are tables for the **Chapter 4: Functional Performance Statements**, **Chapter 5: Generic Requirements**, **Chapter 6: ICT with Two-Way Voice Communication**, **Chapter 7: ICT with Video Capabilities**, **Chapter 8: Hardware**, **Chapter 9: Web**, **Chapter 10: Non-web Documents**, **Chapter 11: General (informative)**, **Chapter 12: Documentation and Support Services**, and also **Chapter 13: ICT Providing Relay or Emergency Service Access**. This covers similar ground to what is addressed in the Section 508 version.

Each WCAG criteria includes space for details about for Web, Non-web document, Open Functionality Software, Closed Software, Authoring Tool, Product Docs, and Support Docs. This is similar to the above comparison.

## EU vs INT

INT combines the 508 & EU regulations into a single document. It avoids duplication for those who need a single document to support all regulations.
