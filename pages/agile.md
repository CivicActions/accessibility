## We are Agile
CivicActions Accessibility is an [agile project](http://agilemanifesto.org/). We use a [project board](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/projects) to iteratively make progress on our goals, collaborate on issues, have open discussions, deliver a [working site](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/) and respond to the changes that happen constantly in the world of accessibility.

## Accessibility and Agile
We encourage accessibility in every part of agile processes. Examples, adding inclusive user archetypes to design sprints, adding accessibility tests to the definition of done, demonstrating how a product is accessible in sprint reviews, prioritizing accessibility goals in retrospectives, delivering accessible product increments, and much more.

### Examples of places to encourage adoption of accessibility
* Understanding accessibility needs in discovery.
  * Developing personas/archetypes that represent accessibility questions in design sprints.
* Adding accessibility requirements to working agreement/definition of done.
* Adding accessibility acceptance criteria to user stories.
  * Creating specific user stories for permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities.
* Using accessibility testing tools:
  * Developing a feature locally.
  * Automated testing when pushing code to a branch or infrastructure.
  * Testing a feature in QA or production.
* User accessibility testing after a feature/project delivery.
* Doing manual testing.
* Reviewing site-wide automated tests.
* Reviewing with assistive technology (VoiceOver/NVDA).

## Examples of our practices
