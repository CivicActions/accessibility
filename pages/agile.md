## Accessibility and agile
CivicActions Accessibility looks to pursue and encourage accessibility in every part of agile processes. Examples, adding inclusive user archetypes to design sprints, adding accessibility tests to the definition of done, demonstrating how a product is accessible in sprint reviews, prioritizing accessibility goals in retrospectives, delivering accessible product increments, and much more.

## Examples of places to encourage adoption of accessibility
* Understanding accessibility needs in [discovery](/guide/discovery).
  * Developing personas/archetypes that represent accessibility questions in design sprints.
* Adding accessibility requirements to working agreement/definition of done.
* Adding accessibility acceptance criteria to user stories.
  * Creating specific user stories for permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities.
* Using accessibility testing tools:
  * Developing a feature locally.
  * Automated testing when pushing code to a branch or to infrastructure.
  * Testing a feature in QA or production.
* User accessibility testing after a feature/project delivery.
* Doing manual testing.
* Reviewing site-wide automated tests.
* Reviewing with assistive technology (VoiceOver/NVDA).
