## We work in the open
CivicActions Accessibility is an open, agile project and community. We work iteratively, in public. Making the digital world accessible by default is a wicked problem, where the only way we will be able to keep up with the rate of change is if we collaborate together. See lists of our open source [resources](/accessibility/handbook/resources), [tools](/accessibility/handbook/tools) and [design systems](/accessibility/handbook/design).
