## What is this?

The *CivicActions Accessibility Handbook* has **specific guidance**, links to **valuable resources**, and **useful tools**. It is where we champion accessibility as a company and highlight issues that are bigger than CivicActions. It intends on being an open place to share *why* and *how* we do things, as it relates to accessibility.

## How does it differ from the CivicActions Handbook?

The [CivicActions Handbook](https://handbook.civicactions.com) provides general overviews and timeless accessibility-related information used for onboarding new staff, as well as explanations on how accessibility relates to various roles within the company. For those who want more in-depth info, the *CivicActions Handbook* will link to content within this *CivicActions Accessibility Handbook* for further reading.
