## Goals
Bring together recommendations for management about how to improve our site

## Needs
Formatted text with larger letters, different font, more spacing, and responsive design

## Thoughts
Wonders if there is a link within the plain text that isn't being emphasized

## Feelings
Disoriented with ornamental animations, especially after staring at a screen all day

## Behaviors
Often magnifies screen up to 200% to focus on specific text

## Pain points
Websites with small text and poor color contrast that keep Avery from identifying their location on a page
