# QA Quincy

## Description
Quincy is always on top of testing. They enjoy breaking websites to make sure they meet criteria for accessibility, and they care about security and performance of the site. They look at automation because testing can take time.

Quincy has a rotator cuff injury and needs to use the keyboard exclusively for a few weeks. 

## Goals
Looking at best practices for QA automation

## Needs
Ability to navigate websites without using a mouse

## Thoughts
How can I further automate my process? Is this accessibility information up-to-date?

## Feelings
Time-pressured for QA work

## Behaviors
Quickly scans content and misses the fine detail. If it's not a bullet point, they won't read it

## Pain points
Tasks that can't be automated
