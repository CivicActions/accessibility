# Remote Raz
Raz wants to work for CivicActions and is keen to see what projects they are involved in. They are keen to work in civic tech because they feel they can have a bigger impact by improving government. They love the great outdoors and are often travelling around to explore the world.

Raz is often trying to connect from a camping ground over their cell phone. They turn off images and minimize bandwidth aggressively to be productive.
