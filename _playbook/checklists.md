Checklists can be helpful for teams. They are usually insufficient to move an organization beyond a limited compliance mindset. There is no single checklist that covers all WCAG issues. As Intopia warned, [a checklist mentality can actually be harmful for inclusion](https://intopia.digital/articles/announcing-the-accessibility-not-checklist/). That said, if approached as part of a broader strategy, they can be very helpful. We recommend that teams might want to customize one to better meet their needs. Access Armada has some interesting suggestions on [more strategic approaches to checklists](https://www.accessarmada.com/blog/building-accessibility-checklists-that-are-actually-useful/). Ultimately though, regularly reviewing your checklists is important. They can be a powerful tool for teams to keep learning how to create more inclusive content.

Microsoft's [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) has both a FastPass and Assessment component. The Assessment component guides users through doing a manual review. Using this tool, organizations could:

* Run the FastPass's automated axe checks on every page.
* Check that the Tab stops follow a logical order when navigating with a keyboard.
* Look over the elements that are marked Needs reviews to see if there are elements where a manual review can identify whether it is an issue or not.
* Complete the rest of the assessment to ensure that the page meets WCAG requirements.

This is a time consuming process, but would give the reviewer a high level of confidence that the site has good accessibility. 

One could also look to use a tool like WebAim's WAVE, ANDI, or Tota11y to scan a web page for errors. In which case a reviewer could do something like this:

* Scan the page with the WAVE Toolbar:
    * Look for clear errors (red boxes with an X in them).
    * See if the alt text effectively describes the images on the page.
    * Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast.
* Do keyboard only testing (using just tab, shift-tab, arrow keys & escape) to navigate the page.
* Evaluate page for plain language using free tools like the [HemingwayApp](https://www.hemingwayapp.com/).
* Magnify the page up to 200% and look for usability and readability issues.

There are lots of checklists, rotating through a few of them will help give different people different things to think about accessibility:

## Checklist

* Have a checklist that builds on automated testing approaches.
* Provide role-based checklists so that different people in the organization are focused on different aspects of accessibility.
* Change your checklists so that new elements can be improved.
* Ensure checklists are short and concise enough that they are used.

## Key questions

* Are you making good use of the time and attention of your staff?
* Are the checklists boring, or supporting your team?
