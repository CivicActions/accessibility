Checklists can be very useful, but there is no single checklist that will cover all WCAG issues. An organization can choose to build one or customize one to meet their needs. Ultimately though, it is useful to change the review process on a regular basis to ensure that people continue to learn new ways to create better content. 

Tools like [Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/) have an assessment component that guides users through a fine tooth manual review of a webpage. Using this tool, organizations could:

* Run the FastPass's automated axe checks on every page.
* Check that the Tab stops follow a logical order when navigating with a keyboard.
* Look over the elements that are marked Needs reviews to see if there are elements where a manual review can identify whether it is an issue or not.
* Complete the rest of the assessment to ensure that the page meets WCAG requirements.

This is a time consuming process, but would give the reviewer a high level of confidence that the site has good accessibility. 

One could also look to use a tool like WebAim's WAVE, ANDI, or Tota11y to scan a web page for errors. In which case a reviewer could do something like this:

* Scan the page with the WAVE Toolbar:
    * Look for clear errors (red boxes with an X in them).
    * See if the alt text effectively describes the images on the page.
    * Ensure that there is sufficient color contrast.
* Do keyboard only testing (using just tab, shift-tab, arrow keys & escape) to navigate the page.
* Evaluate page for plain language using free tools like the [HemingwayApp](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/).
* Magnify the page up to 200% and look for usability and readability issues.

There are lots of checklists, rotating through a few of them will help give different people different things to think about accessibility:

* [WAI](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/)
* [18F](https://accessibility.18f.gov/checklist/)
* [WebAim](https://webaim.org/standards/wcag/checklist)
* [Elsevier's WCAG 2.1 Checklist](https://romeo.elsevier.com/accessibility_checklist/)
* [A11yProject](https://www.a11yproject.com/checklist/)
* [Heydon Works](https://github.com/Heydon/inclusive-design-checklist)
* [VoxMedia](http://accessibility.voxmedia.com/)

## Checklist

* Have a checklist that builds on automated testing approaches.
* Provide role-based checklists so that different people in the organization are focused on different aspects of accessibility.
* Change your checklists so that new elements can be improved.
* Ensure checklists are short and concise enough that they are used.

## Key questions

* Are you making good use of the time and attention of your staff?
* Are the checklists boring, or supporting your team?
