Manual testing is key to any comprehensive accessibility testing plan. We have designed websites in a very mouse-centric way, but there are many people who cannot use a mouse to navigate a site. Although it doesnâ€™t catch everything, basic keyboard only testing can catch many problems that automatic testing will miss. 

Testing should also zoom in so that the page is at least 200% and ideally at 300% with just your browser and not suffer any loss of content or functionality. Just determining if the page still reads well and that navigational elements don't overlap is useful.

Many browsers are now coming out with dark mode and reader mode options. These can be useful for a range of people with disabilities, but also for people looking to optimize their time online. Pages need to be set up properly to access this. 

It is also useful to test sites with Custom CSS stylesheets & Windows High Contrast Mode to determine if there are any elements which are obsucred.
