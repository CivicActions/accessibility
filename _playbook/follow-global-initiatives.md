The European Union is providing a lot of leadership for governments that prioritize accessibility. The Web Accessibility Directive forces member states to measure their accessibility barriers by:
Identifying the barriers in existing Information Communications Technology (ICT) through automated accessibility monitoring, and creating feedback loops through accessibility statements.
Commit to being transparent and accountable by regularly publishing results which allow constituents to see progress on our inclusion goals.

They are also investing in prevention by participating in and leading initiatives that make implementing accessibility easier for everyone. They are making it easier for everyone to have more accessible sites by investing in common Content Management System (CMS) templates and improving the authoring tools.

While we have yet to uniformly implement global accessibility standards, the European Commission strategy has started working more closely with the W3C’s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) to implement best practices.

The two entities co-sponsor a project to build an authoritative guide—WAI-Guide— to support international cooperation for training, advocacy, and capacity building. They are also co-sponsoring another project—WAI-Tools—to develop advanced tools for scalable web accessibility assessments. This public-facing work both contributes to the practice of open government, and ensures that the tools they develop can be maintained by a broader community.
