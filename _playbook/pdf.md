Most PDFs simply  do not meet the Section 508 requirements. It is just simply so easy to produce PDFs, but so difficult to produce accessible ones. There are very few tools that allow you to tell the difference between.  One free tool and easy tool is the Tingtun Checker PDF Checker, but there are others that can provide more detailed results. 

It is possible to create PDF files that meet requirements of Section 508, but it is often overlooked or not done properly.  Often the source documents used to create them do not have proper semantics. It is always more expensive to try to remediate a PDF than to work to build accessibility best practices into the authoring tool.  

The UKâ€™s Government Digital Services model decreases the reliance on PDFs and is actively working to move away from them online and pushing for HTML content instead. When publishing a PDF is unavoidable, ideally an HTML or MSWord version of the content should be available as well.
