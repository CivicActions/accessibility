Develop an accessibility community. There is just so much to learn, and digital accessibility best practices are constantly changing. There is no course or certificate that will give you access to everything your organization needs to be compliant with the law. It takes a community of people to work collectively to find or establish better practices for your website.

The internet has many communities where you can learn more about digital accessibility. There is a [/accessibility subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/accessibility/) or [web-a11y Slack channel](https://www.tpgi.com/anybody-can-be-an-a11y-slacker/) that you can join to learn more. If you are part of a software community like Drupal, there are likely many ways to engage with accessibility people in that space, like an #accessibility channel in whatever messaging platform is used.

The UK's Government Digital Service has proven regular leadership on accessibility in government. They now have thousands of [cross government accessibility community meetups](https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2021/01/21/november-cross-government-accessibility-community-meetup/) and a Slack channel for government employees to talk about accessibility. They have gone so far as to build it into their [Service Manual](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/communities/accessibility-community).

BBC has gone a bit further to look at building out a [Champions network](https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/forproducts/champions/). Not everyone can be an accessibility expert, but we can have more people who care enough about it to become champions. Ability net has a great resource on [how to build and grow your accessibility champions network](https://abilitynet.org.uk/news-blogs/how-build-and-grow-your-accessibility-champions-network).

In isolation it is difficult for any one individual to get accessibility right, and maintain it over time. It really is important to find ways that multiple people within an organization or across related organizations, can have a community to lean on. The Section508.gov's Technology Accessibility Playbook includes a play on [collaborating with the federal accessibility community](https://section508.gov/tools/playbooks/technology-accessibility-playbook-intro/play06).
