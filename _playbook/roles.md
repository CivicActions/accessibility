Creation of modern digital content involves a great many distinct roles. There have been multiple efforts to organize the different roles that occur with each digital team. 
* [USDS's Accessibility for Teams](https://accessibility.digital.gov/) 
* [UK's Department for Work & Pensions' Accessibility Manual (DWP) - Guidance for your job role](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role)
* [Gov.UK Service Manual - What each role does in a service team](https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/the-team/what-each-role-does-in-service-team)
* [Australia Broadcasting Corporation - Accessibility Tips for Teams (PDF)](https://about.abc.net.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/a11y_Tips4Teams.pdf)
* [International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP) - Mapping WCAG2 to Project Roles and Model ICT Accessibility Policy Report](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/content.asp?contentid=347)
* [Deque Labs - Defining Actionable Metrics](https://www.deque.com/blog/accessibility-program-fundamentals-choosing-the-right-accessibility-metrics/) 

We've taken these lists, added other roles that we didn't see included and included them here. With each role we are including tools that we think would be most useful for that role. Where appropriate we have also included links to the W3C's [Accessibility Responsibility Breakdown](https://www.w3.org/community/wai-engage/wiki/Accessibility_Responsibility_Breakdown) for WCAG 2.0 requirements.

## Key questions

* What digital content creation roles does your organization have?
* Where are there opportunities for barriers to be introduced in your digital content?
