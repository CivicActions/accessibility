Creating modern digital content involves a wide array of specialized roles, each contributing to the development process in unique ways. While several efforts have been made to define and categorize these roles, our approach builds on those frameworks by expanding the scope to include roles that are sometimes overlooked.

For each role, we outline responsibilities and recommend tools that support accessibility practices. This guide aims to highlight how every role can contribute to accessibility, fostering collaboration toward more inclusive digital experiences. 

As of March, 2025 we are happy to announce a draft of [Accessibility Roles and Responsibilities Mapping (ARRM)](https://www.w3.org/WAI/planning/arrm/) has been released by the [Web Accessibility Initiative](https://www.w3.org/WAI/). This is recommended reading for all roles involved in accessibility.

## Developer
Developers play a critical part in adding accessibility into the product development lifecycle. They're responsible for implementing best practices and ensuring the product is shipped with accessibility in mind. They bring a diverse set of skills depending on their area of focus. Developers can create interfaces, build robust back end systems, and test their work to make sure it meets quality standards. Accessibility specialists work alongside these roles, guiding technical solutions and ensuring alignment with accessibility guidelines.

## Designer
The practice of design has a vital role to play in moving accessibility thinking earlier in the product development process (a practice known as "shifting left"). Design encompasses a wide variety of tasks and skills. Depending on their area of expertise, a designer could plan and write content, conduct research, or create visual mockups, all while applying accessibility thinking to the design process.

PMs have a unique role to play in finding a cross-functional approach to accessibility that fits the project and the team.

They can uncover patterns and insights to measure the impact of accessibility efforts, evaluate how well digital products meet accessibility standards, and highlight areas for improvement. Treating accessibility as a quality assurance factor is a great way to integrate accessibility and inclusion across an organization's activities.
