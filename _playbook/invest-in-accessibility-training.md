Despite increased investment in accessibility, many government staff have not received adequate (or any) accessibility-specific training. Even as there are many resources available there is generally a lack of awareness—but when people find these resources they are often quick to take advantage. For example, when the UK’s Government Digital Services (GDS) offered a free course on content design through Future Learn, over 10 thousand people signed up.

Some of our favorite, free accessibility courses include:
Web Accessibility by Google;
Digital Accessibility Foundations by the W3C;
Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Accessibility by GeorgiaTech;
Assistive technologies and online learning by the Open University.

Aside from coursework, podcasts are another great way to learn about web accessibility—including A11yRules.com, Interactive Accessibility and Human Potential At Work. While these resources are often available for free, the publishers usually depend on donations to support the ongoing education work. If you choose to listen, please consider contributing to a Patreon campaign to support their wonderful work. In addition Supporting these initiatives is a cost-effective way to increase the availability of new accessibility resources.

There are also several high-quality accessibility guides available for free. The GDS has produced accessibility guides, as has the US government’s 18F. Rather than creating a new guide from scratch, these resources are available to build upon and improve. CivicActions is looking to extend these and other resources to provide an accessibility playbook for our clients and others interested in accessibility best practices.

Public sector employees must be encouraged to take advantage of these resources to best serve their constituents. Accessibility best practices change quickly, so it is important to invest in a sustainable accessibility training program.
