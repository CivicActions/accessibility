Ready to learn more about accessibility? Whether you're just starting or already have some basic knowledge of accessibility, we have resources that can help with your continued education.  

## Certificates for demonstrating accessibility knowledge

At CivicActions we encourage all employees to start with the W3C's EdX course. It provides a solid introduction to the topic for anyone whose work relates to the creation of digital content and products. The additional courses listed here are well-regarded in the United States, and IAAP's CPACC and WAS courses are internationally recognized.

* [W3Cx: Introduction to Web Accessibility](https://www.edx.org/learn/web-accessibility/the-world-wide-web-consortium-w3c-introduction-to-web-accessibility)
* [Certified Professional in Accessibility Core Competencies (CPACC)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/cpacc)
* [Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS)](https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/was-exam)
* [DHS's Section 508 Trusted Tester Conformance Test Process](https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-tester)

## Champions program for CivicActions employees

CivicActions employees who are committed to learning and promoting accessibility are known as Champions. Champions are responsible for fostering awareness and action on digital accessibility within their teams. Our program has three levels that suggest different training and certificates to help people increase their accessibility knowledge. This information might also be of interest to employees of other organizations interested in developing their own internal advocacy programs.
