## Effective Onboarding for an Accessibility Positive Workplace

When hiring new staff, we cannot assume that they are knowledgeable about accessibility. To ensure that there is a \
commitment to digital inclusion, we need to ensure that team members understand the basics. As a digital agency, \
our focus is on web accessibility. Making our content accessible is a key part of customer centered design. A common \
understanding allows our team to work better together. One in five people have a disability, so there is a good \
chance someone on your team will have a disability.
