## Effective Onboarding for an Accessibility Positive Workplace

When hiring new staff, we cannot assume that they are knowledgeable about accessibility. To ensure that there is a \
commitment to digital inclusion, we need to ensure that team members understand the basics. As a digital agency, \
our focus is on web accessibility. Making our content accessible is a key part of customer centered design. A common \
understanding allows our team to work better together. One in five people have a disability, so there is a good \
chance someone on your team will have a disability.

### Trello card - Investigate CivicActions existing resources

Our team has been working to extend the [CivicActions Accessibility](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/) site and integrate key elements into the [CivicActions Handbook](https://handbook.civicactions.com/). CivicActions believes in working in the open, so we also are leveraging tools on GitHub like the [Projects board](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/projects/1) and [Discussions pages](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/discussions).


### Trello card - Install a web accessibility browser extension

Install an accessibility browser extension like [WebAim's WAVE Toolbar extension/plugin](https://wave.webaim.org/extension/) or [Microsoft's Accessibility Insights](https://accessibilityinsights.io/). Take the time to learn the basics of whichever one you choose because everyone has a role in producing accessible websites.

Apple, Windows, Chromebook, Linux desktop OS all have built-in accessibility features. So do mobile systems like Android & iOS.
