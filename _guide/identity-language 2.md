People with disabilities suffer from considerable discrimination, some of which is in the form of language.

When talking about people with a lived experience of disability, we want to be respectful of how people want to be identified. This changes over time, and so it is important to stay up-to-date to see that we are using the language that embraces the equality we are trying to achieve.
