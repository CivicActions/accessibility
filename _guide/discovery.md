## What is discovery?

During initial project discovery, we perform various research and design-related activities to achieve the following goals:

* Understand business needs
* Understand current/historical context
* Understand users
* Understand content needs
* Understand technical needs
* Understand testing needs
* Understand desired high-level outcomes
* Understand major risks and assumptions
* Envision solutions
