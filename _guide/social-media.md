Social media is used to create and share ideas, information, and interests. Accessible social media content allows people with disabilities to engage with these virtual communities instead of being shut out of the conversation. Taking steps to make your social media content accessible means that more people will be able to engage with it!

## Basic guidelines for social media

1. Keep text as clear and simple as possible by using [plain language](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/guide/plain-language). 
     * Use short sentences and choose words your audience uses. 
     * Don't use all-caps. 
     * Spell out abbreviations or acronyms. 
     * Include descriptive text before links. For example, "Read the help page for more info: (LINK)"
2. Add alternative text to all contextual images.  
     * Avoid images with text on them.
     * Use static images instead of animated GIFs
     * Make sure images have strong color contrast.
3. All videos should have captions and transcripts. 
     * Don't forget to review any auto-generated text.
4. Be thoughtful about the use of hashtags.
     * If using hashtags, write them in camel case. This means that each unique word in a hashtag should start with a capital letter. This makes it easier for assistive technology to pronounce hashtags. For example, #WebAccessibility
5. Limit the use of emoji and special characters.
     * Use words instead of emojis to describe things.
     * Add emojis at the end of messages.
     * Be aware of how screen readers voice emoji and special characters—it can change the meaning of your posts. Special characters can have long spoken names when voiced by a screen reader, burdening some of your users more than others.
