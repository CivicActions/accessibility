Emery is always on GitHub and forking projects they are curious about. They have made over 1000 contributions this year and issues lots of PR's. Emery manages two FOSS projects and is always looking for ways to improve them. Some of their projects involve accessibility, so they want to learn more. Emery is often learning from StackExchange and posting questions to the community there. 

Emery just has one eye, but that doesn't stop them. Unfortunately, some VR solutions don't work for them, and they feel sick if there is too much animation on the screen. 

## Goals
Learning best practices about accessibility, particularly for dynamic sites

## Needs
Ability to turn off animations or possibly run the site without JavaScript 

## Thoughts
Will the site have motion on it that makes me feel sick?

## Feelings
Worried the site won't respect my need for reduced motion

## Behaviors
Sometimes disables images on their browser to not worry about them

## Pain points
Sites that are visually more complicated than needed
