Both he and co-presenter Susanna Laurin, Chief Research and Innovation Officer at <a href="https://www.funka.com/en/about-funka2/">Funka</a>, shared the initiatives that they, along with other industry experts, have started to address with the <a href="https://accessibilitycluster.com/">We4Authors Cluster</a> — a pilot funded by the European Commission to create and implement default accessibility features into authoring tools popular in with member states of the European Union.</p><p>The main problem facing web authors is that most Content Management Systems (CMS) expect them to be knowledgeable about accessibility, when the reality is that many of them, including government agents, lack the formal training and technical knowledge to create accessible content.</p><p>As a Drupal core <a href="https://www.drupal.org/u/mgifford">accessibility maintainer</a>, Mike shared the efforts that have been made within the Drupal community to meet <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">ATAG 2.0 standards</a>, and talked about the areas in which they could be improved. Rebuilding CMS interfaces to be both intuitive and reactive, and then making them publicly available, is the next logical step in helping authors to make accessible content more widespread.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/e111fcdd66bd158ee3f371c19d97c15f/href">https://medium.com/media/e111fcdd66bd158ee3f371c19d97c15f/href</a><blockquote>"There are going to be huge benefits for the Drupal community.
