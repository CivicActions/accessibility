<h4>Learn key features of Drupal that help make your site useful to people of all abilities</h4><figure><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*GswpaA5TtwCBYjmph6SIMw.jpeg" /><figcaption>Photo by <a href="https://www.pexels.com/@cliff-booth?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Cliff Booth</a> from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/photo/girl-sitting-on-a-couch-using-a-laptop-4058219/?utm_content=attributionCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=pexels">Pexels</a></figcaption></figure><p>As developers and designers working to help government agencies modernize their IT systems and websites, we are constantly aware of the far-reaching impact of our work. Many people stand to benefit from better government experiences online — that is, if we do our job well. If not, people may struggle to navigate websites that don't properly address accessibility issues.</p><p>We believe that accessibility is not just for meeting requirements — it's for the people (of varying abilities and circumstances) who are relying on government websites for critical information and services. So we built a <a href="https://accessibility.civicactions.com/">community of practice</a> to share and learn with others who are doing this work, and we choose <a href="https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-government-accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281">open source tools that support accessibility</a> in the long term.</p><p>Drupal is one of those tools — a content management platform that is continually updated to help people meet evolving accessibility standards. At <a href="https://events.drupal.org/northamerica2021">DrupalCon North America 2021</a>, CivicActions engineer Jennifer Aube gave a lightning talk to explain some of the features of Drupal that come built-in to support accessibility.
