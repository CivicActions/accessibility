## Treat accessibility issues as bugs, not feature requests

Mike had this [article published with GitHub's ReadME Project](https://github.com/readme/guides/fix-accessibility-bugs) looking back over what worked with Drupal, and how it could apply to more open source projects. 

Drupal is probably the most accessible content management system in the world. This didn't happen over night, and it has taken the input of hundreds of people. Still there are other software communities that can learn from this to make their code more accessible.
