At [DrupalCon Europe 2020](https://events.drupal.org/europe2020), CivicActions
Senior Strategist Mike Gifford discussed the common barriers to accessibility
when authoring content for the web. Both he and co-presenter Susanna Laurin,
Chief Research and Innovation Officer at
[Funka](https://www.funka.com/en/about-funka2/), shared the initiatives that
they, along with other industry experts, have started to address with the
[We4Authors Cluster](https://accessibilitycluster.com/) — a pilot funded by
the European Commission to create and implement default accessibility features
into authoring tools popular in with member states of the European Union.

The main problem facing web authors is that most Content Management Systems
(CMS) expect them to be knowledgeable about accessibility, when the reality is
that many of them, including government agents, lack the formal training and
technical knowledge to create accessible content.

As a Drupal core [accessibility
maintainer](https://www.drupal.org/u/mgifford), Mike shared the efforts that
have been made within the Drupal community to meet [ATAG 2.0
standards](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/), and talked
about the areas in which they could be improved. Rebuilding CMS interfaces to
be both intuitive and reactive, and then making them publicly available, is
the next logical step in helping authors to make accessible content more
widespread.

> with other teams … This is a great way for us to learn from each other and
> test ideas with government authors." — Mike Gifford
