*Government Technology* published a guest editorial we wrote on the new Whitehouse.gov accessibility page.

From the post:

> It's highly encouraging that the new Biden administration is immediately emphasizing the importance of digital accessibility. There appears to be a legitimate commitment from the WhiteHouse.gov team to meet the needs of all people.

> The Web team behind the White House site — like all of us who are working to build accessible government digital services — has a significant challenge ahead, but an equally significant obligation to do the hard work and always be improving. The suggestions here for improving the federal website can generally be applied to state and local governments looking to ensure that all citizens can interact with government. 

> The dawn of the people's government website is upon us.
