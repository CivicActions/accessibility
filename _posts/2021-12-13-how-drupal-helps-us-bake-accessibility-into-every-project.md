As developers and designers working to help government agencies modernize
their IT systems and websites, we are constantly aware of the far-reaching
impact of our work. Many people stand to benefit from better government
experiences online — that is, if we do our job well. If not, people may
struggle to navigate websites that don't properly address accessibility
issues.

We believe that accessibility is not just for meeting requirements — it's for
the people (of varying abilities and circumstances) who are relying on
government websites for critical information and services. So we built a
[community of practice](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/) to share and
learn with others who are doing this work, and we choose [open source tools
that support accessibility](https://medium.com/civicactions/4-ways-to-improve-
government-accessibility-through-open-source-8e20fabc7281) in the long term.

Drupal is one of those tools — a content management platform that is
continually updated to help people meet evolving accessibility standards. At
[DrupalCon North America 2021](https://events.drupal.org/northamerica2021),
CivicActions engineer Jennifer Aube gave a lightning talk to explain some of
the features of Drupal that come built-in to support accessibility. Have a
look!
