I presented on February 5th in the Design track of the conference. The [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1lkUM9mkBSgH0-8pf-kDtPp-FxTCxKEaWd7ze8wA3NA0/edit#slide=id.gde6e9fa718_0_3) and [presentation](https://fosdem.org/2023/schedule/event/accessibility_and_open_source/) are available to those who missed it.  

My presentation focused on my experience in Drupal. Drupal has been a leader in digital accessibility for over an decade. Working with an open community has allowed us to pioneer some new solutions to common design challenges. Working in the open has allowed us to tap expertise outside of our community and given space for people with disabilities to become involved in a variety of roles. Accessibility best practices make it clear that accessibility needs to be considered at all levels of a project.

This talk draws on the experience of the Drupal community but isn't limited to it. I touched on the [We4Authors Cluster](https://accessibilitycluster.com/) initiative of [Funka](https://www.funka.com/en/projekt/we4authors) with the European Commission.
