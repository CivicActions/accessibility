CivicActions is working with the GSA to modernize the VPAT process to ensure that it is machine-readable. The goal of this process is to help make accessibility conformance monitoring easier and more meaningful for everyone. You can more about this project on the [OPAT GitHub Project](https://github.com/GSA/open-product-accessibility-template) and we are actively encouraging people to [submit suggestions](https://github.com/GSA/open-product-accessibility-template/issues) on how it could be improved. 

This project has several goals. We are working to build an Accessibility Conformance Report(ACR) that is:
  - **Transparent** - Easily comparable compliance reports.
  - **Validatable** - Confidence that reports meet minimum standards.
  - **Aggregable** - Enterprise-wide accessibility confidence.
  - **Versioned** - ACRs should follow digital best practices.

Modern ACRs need to be:
  - machine-readable
  - able to integrate with modern software development tools
  - aligned with modern software versioning
  - easily editable and comparable
  - centrally updated and publicly available

Our work with the GSA is helping set the foundation for this work.
