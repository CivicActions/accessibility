I shared my thoughts on the CivicActions blog for how agencies can adopt an open source strategy to make their services more usable by people of all abilities.

From the post:

> As governments seek to make accessibility a priority in today's digital world, it makes sense to start with tools that are purpose-built to evolve along with technology systems and to be part of communities that care deeply about meeting the needs of all users. Open source tools like Drupal and the U.S. Web Design System can help you stay compliant with accessibility regulations, but also to lay a strong foundation for a future in which people of all abilities can more easily benefit from the services you provide.
