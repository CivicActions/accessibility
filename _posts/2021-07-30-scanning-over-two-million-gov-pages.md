On July 22 Mike Gifford and [Luke Fretwell](https://proudcity.com/contacts/luke-fretwell/) had [this article](https://fcw.com/articles/2021/07/22/fed-website-accessibility.aspx) published in FCW (Federal Computer Week) to highlight months of work scanning federal .gov web pages.

We tested against 2.1 AA requirements, the current best practice for digital accessibility standards. The open source tools we used were [Domain Accessibility Audit](https://github.com/MSU-NatSci/DomainAccessibilityAudit) (to crawl the pages) and [axe](https://github.com/dequelabs/axe-core) (to perform the actual accessibility scans).

These problems are happening because accessibility has been an afterthought, even in government. In order for accessibility success to scale in the enterprise we need to take a more holistic approach. For this we have developed our [HEART](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/heart) framework.
