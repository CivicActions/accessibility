I presented [Governments, accessibility and open source](https://www.meetup.com/inclusive-design-accessibility/events/291069715/) in Utrecht. My [slides are available](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1Pm0bVAZwk_NBxeOMvjiTtTXTQBumZjwNgb6MDLDXwSE/edit#slide=id.gde6e9fa718_0_3), and we hope to make the audio available soon. 

My talk focused on some of the challenges that governments are facing as they work to modernize and adopt modern digital first practices. In my talk I address Open Government, open source software and Civic Tech. I highlight how digital accessibility is a huge challenge for governments. Often innovation clashes with inclusive design. There is new legislative pressure on governments, and governments are always struggling to do more with less.
