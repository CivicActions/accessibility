I was interviewed on the [AT Banter Pocast - Episode 230](https://atbanter.com/2021/03/09/at-banter-episode-230-mike-gifford/) on a wide-ranging interview that covered technology, legislation and everything in between. 

From the interview:
> Well, I think that the standards are changing, and the technology is changing. There's, there's a lot of good in that. But it also means that, that you really have to transition how you think about accessibility from being a checklist where you'd say, "yes, it's accessible", to be more of something where you see it as a journey.
