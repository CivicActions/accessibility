We're thrilled to be helping the [GSA](https://www.gsa.gov/) improve its digital accessibility by improving procurement! The standard Accessibility Compliance Report(ACR) for the last two decades has been the Voluntary Product Accessibility Template速 (VPAT速). Moving to a machine-readable format will make it easier for everyone to have better knowledge of software accessibility.

As [announced on g2xchange](https://etc.g2xchange.com/statics/civicactions-receives-contract-award-from-gsa-to-improve-digital-accessibility-of-compliance-reports/) this process will move ACR from an essentially paper-based format to one that is in well structured digital files that can be validated. Having a standardized machine-readable format will make it easier for people to compare between versions of a given digital tool, as well as between multiple tools.
