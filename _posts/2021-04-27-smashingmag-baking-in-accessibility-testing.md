I co-authored an article with [Kate Kalcevich](https://twitter.com/katekalcevich) who is the Head of Services at [Fable](https://makeitfable.com/) about accessibility testing. 

[How To Bake Layers Of Accessibility Testing Into Your Process](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/04/bake-layers-accessibility-testing-process/) introduces "layered accessibility testing" to readers. This is a practice of using a variety of tools and approaches at different stages in the digital product lifecycle to catch accessibility issues early â€” when it's easier and cheaper to fix them.

Using the metaphor of a layered cake, Mike and Kate highlight how teams can gather the ingredients that they need to build accessible products and services.
