# Workflows

## pa11y.yml

Tests the site for accessibility issues using pa11y-ci. The results of the tests are added as comment on the pull request.

pa11y-ci is configured with the file [.pa11yci](.pa11yci).

The pa11y-ci commands can also be run locally to generate the same test results:

* `npm run start-detached` this will start the local server in a detached state.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:home` run pa11y-ci against the home page.
* `npm run pa11y-ci:sitemap` run pa11y-ci against all URLs generated by the sitemap except for PDFs.

### Axe

To run pa11y with axe replace the .pa11yci file with [.pa11yci_with_axe](.pa11yci_with_axe) before execution.

## reviewdog.yml

Run remark-lint with reviewdog on pull requests to check for readibility and other text checks.
