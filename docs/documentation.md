# How to work on to the Accessibility site

The site is using the [USWDS theme](https://designsystem.digital.gov/) built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
## How we work
We as a team have created a [board](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/projects/1) where we can collaborate our work. Here we can track what work is in the backlog or in progress. 

Email [accessibility@civicactions.com](mailto:accessibility@civicactions.com) or message in slack #accessibility for access to the [github repo](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility)
Once added to the github repo, if you find any issues, spelling mistake, or an idea you think should be added to the site, create an issue.

## Create an issue
1. Visit [create an issue page](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/issues/new/choose)
2. Choose the type of issue
    * Add new team member to repo
    * Bug report
    * Feature request
    * General issue
    * Retrospective
3. Add a title and a description and click submit

The ticket will be added to the backlog column on the [board](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/projects/1)

## Working on an issue
All tickets should be kept in the backlog. Tickets in To-do column are added by a team member who is committing to working on this ticket in the current week. 
When working on a ticket, the ticket should be moved to the In-progress column on the [board](https://github.com/CivicActions/accessibility/projects/1)

## How to add content
To create a page with content, can be done directly in github. 
The repo is has been setup for different sections
* About
* Calendar
