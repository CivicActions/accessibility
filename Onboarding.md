## Role Specific Workshops

Each role in a company may need additional support in how they can best do their job. The UK's [DWP Accessibility Manual](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/) does a great job in [Guidance for your job role](https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role) as does the USA's [Accessibility for Teams](https://accessibility.digital.gov/). You may need additional training materials for roles like:

* Business Analyst
* Content Designer
* Delivery Manager
* Digital Performance Analyst
* Interaction Designer
* Product Manager
* QA Tester
* Software Engineer or Frontend Developer
* User Researcher
