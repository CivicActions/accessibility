# Onboarding in an Accessibility Positive Workplace - DRAFT

To ensure that there is commitment throughout the organization is accessibility, we need to ensure that team members are educated on accessibility, because this cannot be assumed. As a digital agency, our focus is on web accessibility. Making our content accessible is a key part of customer centred design. A basic understanding of accessibility issues is important for all staff because it allows our team to work more effectively together. 1/5 people have a disability, so there is a good chance that in an organization our size that not everyone perceives, operates or understands content the same way.
