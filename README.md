# Accessibility

This repository and [website](https://accessibility.civicactions.com/) are the single source of truth for work on digital accessibility at [CivicActions](https://civicactions.com/). This work is being done in the open because it is a best practice. 

Working in the open allows us to  
* keep up with the work of other accessibility experts and engage with them;
* share best practices we want to see widely adopted;
* bring in other areas of our work that touch on accessibility;
* embrace the journey of accessibility - being more accessible today than we were yesterday. 

## Another CivicActions site {#civicactions}

This is not a duplication of content on hour homesite or our [CivicActions Handbook Accessibility Section](https://handbook.civicactions.com/en/latest/060-engineering/accessibility/#accessibility). Accessibility touches all aspects of an inclusive organization, so eventually we will have content about inclusion in our [Distributed Government](https://distributedgov.com/) site. 

This site is not a duplication, but an intentional and practical extension. As an example, all CivicActions employees are expected to be familiar with the material in the handbook, but not everyone needs to implement accessibility in their job.  

## Our Mission {#mission}

Diversity equity and inclusion are key to any effective team, and CivicActions is no exception. Accessibility is a key part of this, as over 26% of Americans identify as having a disability. Our team is excited about finding new ways to build better products, and this includes removing barriers for people with disabilities. 

CivicActions is an impact driven business that sees digital accessibility as something where we can make a positive difference. By working in the open with open source tools, we can not only improve our own work, but help shape how our industry grapples with this challenging issue. By working with governments and non-profit clients, we can ensure that our projects continue to improve over time.
